# Purpose
I made this page as a frontend exercise for my portfolio. It's the Green Tech landing page, created from scratch by eye. It's not a 100% replica but it's close enough.

Made with ES2015, Webpack and Sass.

# Commands
`npm run build` to rebuild assets.

`npm run build:prod` to deploy.

`npm run clean` if you ever wish to delete `dist/`
